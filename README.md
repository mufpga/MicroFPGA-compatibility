# MicroMojo and MicroFPGA

MicroMojo is an early iteration of [MicroFPGA](https://mufpga.github.io). It is based on a discontinued FPGA.

[MicroFPGA](https://mufpga.github.io) is an FPGA-based platform for the electronic control of microscopes. It aims at using affordable FPGA to generate or read signals from a variety of devices, including cameras, lasers, servomotors, filter-wheels, etc. It can be controlled via [Micro-Manager](https://micro-manager.org/), or its [Java](https://github.com/mufpga/MicroFPGA-java), [Python](https://github.com/mufpga/MicroFPGA-py) and [LabView](https://github.com/mufpga/MicroFPGA-labview) communication libraries, and comes with optional complementary [electronics](https://github.com/mufpga/MicroFPGA-electronics).

## Content

This repository contains the Alchitry protects and Micro-Manager device adapters for V1 and v2:

- v1: the original MicroMojo, kept here for back compatibility.
- v3: a version compatible with MicroFPGA, including the newest features such as active camera trigger. 

For more details on how to build and use MicroFPGA or Mojo v3, refer to the [project homepage](https://mufpga.github.io).
